## Option 1: Run CHORDS on Amazon Web Services

### Amazon Web Services

If you don't have an AWS account, it's easy to create one. The standard CHORDS portal uses an Amazon "micro instance", which can be free for the first year.

If you are NSF funded then you can use a Jestream instance free! If you aren't that's still ok. You can apply for a trial account similar Amazon and request more allocations later while contributing to the scientific community!

## Option 4: Other
    
Sadly our crystal ball broke before we could foresee all of your needs. If you aren’t able to find an option that suits your projects needs there are many options for virtual machines (vm’s) and servers out there.
