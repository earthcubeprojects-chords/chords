  Although this example is for a specific instrument, the syntax is common to all of them.
  %i instrument_id
  specifies the instrument. For putting data, there is a list of variable short names with their corresponding
  measurement value. All of the qualifiers (i.e. the fields following "?" and "") are order independent.

      The optional qualifier section begins with a "?", followed by one or more qualifiers. Each is separated by "".
      Some qualifiers (e.g. at, start and end) have an associated value.
      %li Time qualifiers (at, start and end) are in ISO8061 format.
      %li If none of the time qualifiers are present for a data fetch, measurements for the current day are returned.
