# paws_to_chords instructions and configuration.
#
# Instructions for 'paws_to_chords', followed by a sample configuration
# JSON structure.
#
# This whole file can be used a configuration template. Comment lines that begin with a 
# leading hash charcter will be stripped by paws_to_chords.
#
# One instance of paws_to_chords will process data for a single CHORDS instrument, submitting
# it to a CHORDS Portal.
# 
# paws_to_chords will periodically scan a list of directories, finding the file that
# was most recently modified in each directory. It will then examine the last line
# that file, and extract a timestamp and one or more variable values.
#
# The variable values will be paired with the CHORDS short_names.
# All of the timestamp/short_name/value triples will be used to build a CHORDS URL which will then
# be submitted to a chords_portal. If different timestamps are encountered, a URL for
# each unique timestamp will be submitted.
#
# The data lines in a file are formatted with whitespace separated variable values as follows:
# month day year hour minute var1 ... varN

# Command line usage of paws_to_chords:
#
# usage: paws_to_chords --config config_file [--key key_value] [--test] [--verbose]
#  --config file_name  The configuration file
#  --key key_value     (optional) The chords portal security key.
#  --test              (optional) Add the "test" data qualifier.
#  --verbose           (optional) Print detailed diagnostic information.

#  Configuration keys (used in the JSON structure below):
#  chords_host:     The CHORDS Portal IP.
#  instrument_id:   The CHORDS instrument id.
#  top_dir:         The top directory for all of the sensor subdirectories.
#                   If there is no common top directory, just set it to root
#                   and specify all sub-directories as absolute paths.
#  cycle_secs:      The directory scan interval, in seconds.
#  sensors:         A list of sensors, with one entry for each sensor data directory.
#    short_names:   A list of short names, corresponding to the data field for each
#                   variable. Most sensors will only have one variable in the PAWS data file,
#                   but some may have multiple variables on each data line, e.g. a 
#                   wind sensor which produces the pair wind speed, wind direction.
#                   Use a "*" to indicate a field which should be skipped.
#    sub_dir:       Combine with top_dir as top_dir/sub_dir to specify the location
#                   where data files are found for that sensor.
#    file_pattern:  A shell style "glob pattern" for matching files. Thus the 
#                   selected files will be top_dir/sub_dir/file_pattern.
